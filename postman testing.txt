Postman testing

For post functions, make sure you have a BODY and set raw and also the end setting
is set to JSON.

You go to Person Controller and look at signup function.  There is a RequestBody which
should direct you back to the Person Model.  There you see from the Column Annotations
that the Body is composed of email, username and password.
Then create an email, password, username in the Body of postman.  Use commas after
each entry except the last.  

For signup there may be issues if there is authorization required (We have security
set up through Spring.)
