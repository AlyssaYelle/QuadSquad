## Final Thoughts
Project 2 proved to be more accessible and easier to transform from concept to completion than Project 1. We had cultivated more experience working both independently and in group settings on class lab assignments and thus, more seemed to go well for our team than awry. Our general approach was to first create an ER diagram to establish the database relations between a person using the app, posts created, comments made to a post and any other necessary entities. Then we set about writing the code for the program files following the general workflow of creating models, repositories, service files, implementation files, and then controllers. White boarding was very helpful in the process of discussing relations, especially when we had to revise the roles and make tweaks to the mappings.

The pushing and pulling and merging of content through Github was sometimes a nuisance. On the very first day of working together, a substantial amount of file creation was lost due to a git-ignore error. Files that were supposed to be ignored were not and ended up in the 'master,' and this caused unfixable compilation errors. We abandoned attempts at debugging and decided to start the project over. Another hurdle was the realization that the front end and back end could not communicate with one another due to port sharing conflicts. This required research and the implementation of a CORS security file which was wholly unfamiliar to us.

One advantage gained while working on Project 2 was our ability to make use of a three-member team. Simply put: more help in accomplishing tasks. None of the hurdles proved excessively challenging. We even found enough time to devise a new front end design and concept. Writing user stories for the concept was left for the end of the process.

Overall we enjoyed working on and completing this project. We gained immeasurably from the exercise of putting everything we had learned about Springboot into practice.
